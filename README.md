## startscript

Are you tired of having to create the assigned list of files and making sure the file names are perfect?

I am. So I created a script to do it. Improve it. Make it better. Share!

### Warning

Make sure you don't run this script in a directory where you  have finished work.

### How to use it

1. Create an empty directory with the assigned name (e.g., 0x09-c_hates_kittens)

2. Goto your assignment page and select all (CTRL-A)

3. Create a file named "Files" in your assignment directory (created in step 1)

4. Paste the content from the assignment page in the "Files" txt document. Save.

5. Place "startscript" in this directory and execute it.
